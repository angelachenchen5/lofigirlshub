      <br><br>
      In order to tell a compelling and effective story, storytellers must construct a magically immersive world in which the story takes place; a process known as <a href="https://www.well-storied.com/blog/an-introduction-to-world-building">worldbuilding</a>. Some stories require more detailed worldbuilding than others, but in the end the point is the same: suspend our disbelief, draw us in, make us buy into the world that has been created, and Miyazaki has been known to do just that. Miyazaki uses worldbuilding to achieve a sense of immersive realism that strike a difficult balance between fantasy and reality.
